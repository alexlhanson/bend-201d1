# Class 5: Understanding Images, plus CSS for Color & Text Styling

<a id="top"></a>
## Today's Plan: Week 1, Friday Lecture

### Today's Schedule
- Questions + code review + discussion on Thursday's lab
- [Quick run through the readings](#readings)
- More on functions!
- More on the "Learn Layout" content from yesterday with as much time as we have

**15-minute break at 10:15am**

- [Git Branching, including deployment](#git) *[30 minutes]*
- [Lab overview](#lab) *[45 minutes]*


### Announcements

  - **Reminder:** Quizzes are open-book, so use the resources you choose to figure out the answers: books, internetz, JS console in your browser, whatever. And remember that the quizzes are preparing you for the 301 entrance exam, which you will take on the last weekend of this class (right before Project Week).
  - **Reminder:** Weekly surveys will go out to students in email today. Your survey responses are very helpful and meaningful to us. Feedback is a gift.
  - We will wrap class by 11:45 today. Why? Today is your first **Partner Power Hour**, which is when we have alums and industry partners come give a lunchtime presentation. Recall, Brandy talked about these on the very first day, and your attendance is required. Here's [info on the presentation](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/partner-power-hour-working-with-a-product-manager-tickets-42956624420). The presentation starts at 12:15, so us stopping class at 11:45 gives you a solid 30 minutes to grab a bite and a break.
  - Sam's Code 301 class is doing their presentations of final projects this afternoon at 1:30p. They have been in Project Week all week, just as you will be in Week 4 of our class. You should try to go watch at least one project team's presentation today just to get a feel for what those are like.
	- *Note: On project presentation days, lunch is provided for the students who are presenting. Unfortunately... that ain't you. Yet. But if, at the end of lunch, there are leftovers, you're welcome to partake!*


**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 5 of Code 201, students will:

- Extend their understanding of how functions work in JavaScript, as well as the component pieces including declarations, calls, parameters, arguments, and returns, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
- Be able to publish a static webpage on GitHub by creating a gh-pages branch.
- Extend their understanding of use of images, color, and text formatting to style and HTML page, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
- Extend their understanding of image formats (JPG, GIF, PNG) and the strengths/weaknesses of each format, as measured by a quiz administered in Canvas.

## Git branching, including deployment

It's time to take a look at branching in Git, so let's get out the iPad and draw some diagrams!

We'll also go over the commands and do some practice with Git branches together in our terminals.

## Code demo for today's lab

Today's lab is a 'one-off' lab, in that it is not directly connected to your weekly project.

This will be your first experience working with starter code. It's different than what we've done so far, but when you think about it, represents a real-world scenario where you go to work somewhere that already has an existing codebase. You'll be doing extensive work from starter code in Code 301.

You'll be working individually today. The GitHub workflow today is different, too, and is designed to give you a lot of practice working with branches, which is the last major piece of Git for us to cover. We need to spend a bit of time with it, and get practice with it, so that you understand what you are doing.

The concepts covered in today's lab (functions that receive input and return output) will be VERY VERY helpful for you in next week's project. Ideally you will continue to work on little problems like this over the weekend for additional practice. If you haven't, go sign up at Code Wars and take a look around, and join the Code Fellows clan there.
